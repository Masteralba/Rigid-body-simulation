# Physically Based Modeling

Work is inspired by David Baraff notes named *"Rigid Body Simulation"*:  

[https://graphics.pixar.com/pbm2001/pdf/notesg.pdf](https://graphics.pixar.com/pbm2001/pdf/notesg.pdf)

Code implements **Perfect elastic collision**. Falling body is a general tetrahedron. ODE solver uses classical RK-4 method.

Graphics is made with OpenGL:
